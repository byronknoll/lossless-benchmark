                    <li>
                        Results must be publicly verifiable. Compression programs must be free for personal use without
                        expiration date (no trialware) and without registration. Publishing benchmark results must not
                        be prohibited in program license.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By default programs are ranked by compressed enwik9 size + decompressor size. Decompressor size
                        may be based on publicly available source code (if it exists) or executable size. Decompressor
                        itself may be compressed to .7z format using LZMA compression.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decompressor must be self-contained. It must not rely on any data that is not contained in
                        decompressor package. Any libraries that are not available in stock OS install must also be
                        placed in decompressor package.
